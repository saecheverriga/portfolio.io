                    <li>Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago that offers a fun, convenient, and affordable way to get around the city.
                        Founded in 2016, Cyclistic has a fleet of 5,824 bikes and 692 stations. Riders can unlock bikes from any station and return
                         them to any other station in the system. Cyclistic is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and its team of dedicated employees 
                         are committed to providing a great biking experience for all users. In this case study, I show a data analysis for a fictional 
                         bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders.

                <p>
                    This dataset contains information about rides, such as bike type (docked, classic and electric), start and end stations names and ID's with geographical lat and long coordenates and last the rideable type (casual or member).

                <p>
                    In this case I used the data from 1 year, starting april 2022 to may 2023, taking from the total of 5.83 million rows, a sample of 200000 which represents more than 99.999% in confidence level and almost 0.5% in margin of error. It was made by using RStudio using merge and sample functions. (see process steps)

                    I used the library geosphere for calulating the distance among coordenates, i used functions such as distHaversine and as.isnumeric and also I used vectors for recheck data calculations.

                    For checking the process steps, i used the glimpse funtion. I also used the cbind function for checking purposes. At the end I extracted the information as a .csv file.

                <li>Membership Benefits and Incentives: Offer exclusive benefits and incentives to casual users who sign up for a membership. This could include discounted rates, priority access to bikes during peak hours, free additional ride time, or access to special events or promotions. Highlight the advantages of being a member, such as cost savings, convenience, and a more personalized experience.</li>
                <li>Focus on peak months: Since June, July, and August are the peak months for both types of users, it would be wise to allocate additional resources during these periods. This could involve ensuring a higher number of available bikes, increasing staff presence at stations, and implementing efficient maintenance schedules to meet the increased demand.</li>
                <li>Improve accessibility in areas distant from the beach: Since the data shows that there are fewer users in these areas, it would be beneficial to enhance the bike-sharing system's presence and infrastructure in these regions. This could involve increasing the number of stations and bikes available, as well as promoting the system's benefits to attract more users.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>While there are countless activities to explore, here are three excellent starting points to kickstart this project.</li>
